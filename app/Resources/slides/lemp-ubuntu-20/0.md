## Introduction

The LEMP software stack is a group of software that can be used to serve dynamic web pages and web applications written in PHP. This is an acronym that describes a **L**inux operating system, with an Nginx (pronounced like “**E**ngine-X”) web server. The backend data is stored in the **M**ySQL database and the dynamic processing is handled by **P**HP.

This guide demonstrates how to install a LEMP stack on an Ubuntu 20.04 server. The Ubuntu operating system takes care of the first requirement. We will describe how to get the rest of the components up and running.


## Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need access to an Ubuntu 20.04 server as a regular, non-root `sudo` user, and a firewall enabled on your server. To set this up, you can follow our [initial server setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04).
