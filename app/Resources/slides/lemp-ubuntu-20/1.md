## 1 – Installing the Nginx Web Server

In order to display web pages to our site visitors, we are going to employ Nginx, a high-performance web server. We'll use the `apt` package manager to obtain this software.

Since this is our first time using `apt` for this session, start off by updating your server’s package index. Following that, you can use `apt install` to get Nginx installed:

```command
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```
When prompted, enter `Y` to confirm that you want to install Nginx. Once the installation is finished, the Nginx web server will be active and running on your Ubuntu 20.04 server.

If you have the `ufw` firewall enabled, as recommended in our initial server setup guide, you will need to allow connections to Nginx. Nginx registers a few different UFW application profiles upon installation. To check which UFW profiles are available, run:

```command
sudo ufw app list
```
```
[secondary_label Output]
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you need. Since you haven't configured SSL for your server in this guide, you will only need to allow regular HTTP traffic on port `80`.

Enable this by typing:

```command
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

You can verify the change by running:

```command
sudo ufw status
```

This command’s output will show that HTTP traffic is now allowed:

```
[secondary_label Output]
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
<^>Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere<^>
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
<^>Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)<^>
```

With the new firewall rule added, you can test if the server is up and running by accessing your server's domain name or public IP address in your web browser.

If you do not have a domain name pointed at your server and you do not know your server's public IP address, you can find it by running the following command:

```command
ip addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
```

This will print out a few IP addresses. You can try each of them in turn in your web browser.

As an alternative, you can check which IP address is accessible, as viewed from other locations on the internet:

```command
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

Type the address that you receive in your web browser and it will take you to Nginx's default landing page:

```
http://<^>server_domain_or_IP<^>
```

If you see this page, it means you have successfully installed Nginx and enabled HTTP traffic for your web server.
