## 4 — Configuring Nginx to Use the PHP Processor

When using the Nginx web server, we can create _server blocks_ (similar to virtual hosts in Apache) to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server. In this guide, we'll use **your_domain** as an example domain name. To learn more about setting up a domain name with DigitalOcean, see our [introduction to DigitalOcean DNS](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/).

On Ubuntu 20.04, Nginx has one server block enabled by default and is configured to serve documents out of a directory at `/var/www/html`. While this works well for a single site, it can become difficult to manage if you are hosting multiple sites. Instead of modifying `/var/www/html`, we'll create a directory structure within `/var/www` for the **your_domain** website, leaving `/var/www/html` in place as the default directory to be served if a client request doesn't match any other sites.

Create the root web directory for **your_domain** as follows:

```command
sudo mkdir /var/www/<^>your_domain<^>
```

Next, assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:

```command
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/<^>your_domain<^>
```

Then, open a new configuration file in Nginx's `sites-available` directory using your preferred command-line editor. Here, we'll use `nano`:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/<^>your_domain<^>
```

This will create a new blank file. Paste in the following bare-bones configuration:

```
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain]
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <^>your_domain<^> www.<^>your_domain<^>;
    root /var/www/<^>your_domain<^>;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}


```

Here’s what each of these directives and location blocks do:

* `listen` — Defines what port Nginx will listen on. In this case, it will listen on port `80`, the default port for HTTP.
* `root` — Defines the document root where the files served by this website are stored.
* `index` — Defines in which order Nginx will prioritize index files for this website. It is a common practice to list `index.html` files with a higher precedence than `index.php` files to allow for quickly setting up a maintenance landing page in PHP applications. You can adjust these settings to better suit your application needs.
* `server_name` — Defines which domain names and/or IP addresses this server block should respond for. **Point this directive to your server's domain name or public IP address.**
* `location /` — The first location block includes a `try_files` directive, which checks for the existence of files or directories matching a URI request. If Nginx cannot find the appropriate resource, it will return a 404 error.
* `location ~ \.php$` — This location block handles the actual PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the `fastcgi-php.conf` configuration file and the `php7.4-fpm.sock` file, which declares what socket is associated with `php-fpm`.
* `location ~ /\.ht` — The last location block deals with `.htaccess` files, which Nginx does not process. By adding the `deny all` directive, if any `.htaccess` files happen to find their way into the document root ,they will not be served to visitors.


When you're done editing, save and close the file. If you're using `nano`, you can do so by typing `CTRL+X` and then `y` and `ENTER` to confirm.

Activate your configuration by linking to the config file from Nginx's `sites-enabled` directory:

```command
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<^>your_domain<^> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Then, unlink the default configuration file from the `/sites-enabled/` directory:

```command
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

<$>[note]
**Note**: If you ever need to restore the default configuration, you can do so by recreating the symbolic link, like this:

```command
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
<$>

This will tell Nginx to use the configuration next time it is reloaded. You can test your configuration for syntax errors by typing:

```command
sudo nginx -t
```

If any errors are reported, go back to your configuration file to review its contents before continuing.

When you are ready, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```command
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Your new website is now active, but the web root `/var/www/<^>your_domain<^>` is still empty. Create an `index.html` file in that location so that we can test that your new server block works as expected:

```command
nano /var/www/<^>your_domain<^>/index.html
```

Include the following content in this file:

```
[label /var/www/your_domain/index.html]
<html>
  <head>
    <title><^>your_domain<^> website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>This is the landing page of <strong><^>your_domain<^></strong>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now go to your browser and access your server's domain name or IP address, as listed within the `server_name` directive in your server block configuration file:

```
http://<^>server_domain_or_IP<^>
```

You'll see a page like this:

![Nginx server block](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/lemp_ubuntu2004/landing_page.png)

If you see this page, it means your Nginx server block is working as expected.

You can leave this file in place as a temporary landing page for your application until you set up an `index.php` file to replace it. Once you do that, remember to remove or rename the `index.html` file from your document root, as it would take precedence over an `index.php` file by default.

Your LEMP stack is now fully configured. In the next step, we'll create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle `.php` files within your newly configured website.
