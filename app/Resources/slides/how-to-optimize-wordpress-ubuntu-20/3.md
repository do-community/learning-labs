## 3 — Optimize for Security and Performance

Once you have installed all of the plugins, widgets, and additional features you’d like to add to your WordPress installation, there are a few more optimization options to try within the WordPress dashboard that could positively impact your site’s speed and performance.

### Tweaking WordPress Settings

First, be sure to change your site’s login address. Because most WordPress administrative login pages end in `/wp-admin`, this page is often prone to attacks. There are a [number of tools available](https://wordpress.org/plugins/change-wp-admin-login/) that enable you to change your login URL — be sure to select the one that works best for your use case.

Next, consider the **Site Health** tool, located in the **Tools** section of your WordPress dashboard:

Consider the results shown, and follow the instructions found in each dropdown on the **Status** tab to improve security or performance as mentioned within the tabs.

Using the built-in configuration offered in the WordPress dashboard ensures that you’ve covered all of the readily available configuration tweaks for your installation.

### Caching for Site Speed

Caching can also help improve your WordPress site’s performance and speed. [Caching](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/web-caching-basics-terminology-http-headers-and-caching-strategies), a core design feature of the HTTP protocol meant to minimize network traffic while improving the perceived responsiveness of the system as a whole, can be used to help minimize load times when implemented on your site. WordPress offers a number of [caching plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) that are helpful in maintaining a *snapshot* of your site to serve static HTML elements, reducing the amount of PHP calls and improving page load speed.
