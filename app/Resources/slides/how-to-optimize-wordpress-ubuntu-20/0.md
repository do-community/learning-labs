In this tutorial, you’ll explore how to optimize WordPress installations in a way that’s built for scale, including guidance on configuration, speed, and overall performance.


## Prerequisites

This is a **conceptual article** sharing different ways to approach optimization of a WordPress installation on Ubuntu 20.04. While this tutorial references the use of a managed solution via our [WordPress 1-Click App](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress), there are many different starting points, including:

- A [hosted solution](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) providing WordPress on Ubuntu 20.04
- [Manual installation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-a-lamp-stack) on a Droplet
- A [1-Click App](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress) solution providing WordPress on Ubuntu 20.04

Whichever you choose, this tutorial will start with the assumption that you have or are prepared to install a fully-working WordPress installation configured with an administrative user on Ubuntu 20.04.
