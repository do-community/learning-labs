## 1 — Consider Your Installation

During the installation and creation of your WordPress installation there are a few variables to take into account, including the location of your potential users, the scope of your WordPress site or suite of sites, and the maintenance and security preferences set that allow your site to be continually optimized. Taking the time to dive into each thoughtfully before building out your site will save time and benefit your WordPress installation as it grows.

### Considering Your Site’s Potential

The first step in optimizing your WordPress site is to have a deep understanding of how you intend to use and grow your site. Will it be one site, or a network of sites? Is your site a static or dynamic website? Answering these questions before setting up your installation can inform some of your initial decisions regarding hosting, storage size, and performance.

For example, if you’d like to build a personal blog, [caching and optimizing images and visual content is important to consider.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/web-caching-basics-terminology-http-headers-and-caching-strategies) If you intend to create a community or ecommerce site with concurrent visitors and frequently changing data, [considerations for server resources should be made.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-remote-database-to-optimize-site-performance-with-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04) Being thoughtful about your intention for your WordPress installation from the start will guide the usefulness of security and performance tweaks made to your site, and lend to an overall more efficient installation.

### Optimizing Installation Preferences

There are a few preferences that are important to consider while installing WordPress that can reduce latency and increase performance on your site.

#### Hosting and Included Software

First, select a hosting provider that provides the latest [WordPress](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/wordpress), [Apache](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-apache), [MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/mysql), and [PHP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/php) software with firewall and SSL certificate capabilities. A reliable and modern hosting provider will give you the best start for your `LAMP` stack installation. With shared hosting, be aware of server usage and customers per server to ensure the best performance for your site. Choosing the right hosting provider for your needs will help you prevent downtime and performance errors.


#### Location and Latency

Be aware of the location of your servers or datacenters when starting a new WordPress installation, and choose the location that best suits the need of your site and general location of your visitors and users. Latency, the time it takes for data to be transmitted between your site and users, fluctuates based on location. The Wordpress documentation on [site analytic tools](https://wordpress.com/support/stats/) explains how to track visitor location data, as well as the number of visits to your site. Having an idea from the start about where your visitors are from can help determine where to host your site and provide them with a faster browsing experience.
