### Transcription

Ansible is an open source configuration management tool that provides a minimalist server automation framework based on YAML definitions. Its simplified infrastructure requirements and accessible syntax helped make Ansible one of the most popular configuration management tools to date.

Unlike most tools in the same category, Ansible doesnâ€™t require specialized software to be installed on remote nodes. A control machine is set up with the Ansible software, which then communicates with the nodes via standard SSH, using Python to execute remote instructions.

Ansible provides a large collection of built-in modules to facilitate automating common server tasks such as installing packages, creating and managing users, manipulating files and permissions, and managing services.
