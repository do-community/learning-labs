### Transcription

Docker is a popular open source containerization tool used to provide a portable and consistent runtime environment for software applications, while consuming less resources than a traditional server or virtual machine. Docker uses containers, isolated user-space environments that run at the operating system level and share system resources such as the kernel and the filesystem.

While other container systems exist, Docker became popular for providing a more accessible and comprehensive interface around the technology, and for creating a public repository of base container images that users can build upon when creating containerized environments to run their applications.
