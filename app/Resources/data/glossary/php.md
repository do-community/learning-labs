### Transcription

PHP is a general-purpose programming language created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. Originally designed to facilitate building web pages with dynamic components, PHP has seen many changes and improvements since its first release. These changes, along with the rise in popularity of WordPress, a free and open-source content management system written in PHP, have helped it become one of the most popular programming languages for the web.

Popular PHP frameworks include Laravel, Symfony, Zend, Slim, among others. For dependency management, PHP developers typically rely on Composer, the de facto standard for dependency management in modern PHP applications.
